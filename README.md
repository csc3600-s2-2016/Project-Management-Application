-----------------------
Create a web application using the LAMP platform that allows users to create a project description, log time expended, and produce reports.

Specifically it should provide this functionality:
* Create tasks and sub-tasks
* reorganise task hierarchy
* rename tasks
* delete tasks that have no time expenditure
* Record time estimates for tasks
* Log time by project staff against tasks
* Report summaries by task; by staff; overall summaries.
